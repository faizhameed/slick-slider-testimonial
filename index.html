          communication on multiple channels. Most important is ease of use. You
          can track each campaign ROI with success rate and its impact."

          “No doubt Teleduce is an excellent product for a startup like us. One
          thing that I admire the most about corefactors is their support and
          client relationship."

          “RupeeCircle team was using excel sheet for managing enquiries. We
          were using various colours to differentiate various stages of leads,
          handwritten notes for task and calls. We don't have a track of whom to
          call and which lead to being concentrated first. The team wants to get
          rid of their manual job. We started using Teleduce. Now the team is
          saving time and our productivity has increased.”
